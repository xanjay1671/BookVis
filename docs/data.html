          <p>Our dataset is comprised of 10000 most popular books, as noted in a snapshot of popularity taken in 2016.
            We selected this dataset because it had more details for each entry availible and the bias towards
            popularity makes the results more representitive of the books you could expect to find.</p>
          <p>Note the peak in 2012 - books seem to take a little while to gain momentum and popularity. When updated for
            a later dataset, we would expect to see a similar delay as people need time to find, read, and record newly
            published books.</p>

          Pictured above is a heatmap that shows the overlap between genres in the dataset. Because each book can have
          multiple genres, we can identify genres that have significant or little overlap with one another. For
          instance,
          the bright yellow square at the intersection between nonfiction and business indicates that most business
          books
          are also tagged as nonfiction.
        </p>
        <p>
          The heatmap is not symmetrical - this is due to each genre having a different number of books. For example,
          all
          cookbooks may be nonfiction, but not all nonfiction books are cookbooks. This is most evident with the fiction
          row, where many genres predominantly consist of books that are also labelled as fiction.
        </p>
        <p>
          To improve readability of the streamgraphs and other charts, we decided to reduce the number of genres to
          minimize visual clutter. Ultimately, we grouped the smallest 23 genres into an 'other' category, keeping the
          15
          largest genres separate.
        </p>
        <p>
          The condensed heatmap below reflects this change. The 'other' genre significantly reduces the visual
          complexity
          - at the cost of lost information - while also addressing the issue of extremely sparse data with some genres.
          The humor genre, for instance, only has 4 books associated with it. This can lead to rows in the full heatmap
          being relatively binary - either fully overlapping or not at all. Overall, the condensed heatmap is more
          balanced, with much fewer extremes.
